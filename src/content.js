              Another important aspect on the request URL matching expression that might be easy to miss, is that sometimes
              we perform requests to the same domain, thus we do not have the domain present in the request URL, we simply
              write the path. In those cases, if you specify the full URL in the tweak configuration <b>the request will be a mismatch and will
