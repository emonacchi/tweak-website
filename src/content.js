            No. tweak has its own <b>limitations</b>, currently:
            <ul>
              <li>
                It will only apply the configurations to the browser tab where you configure the requests to intercept and
                activate the extension (by clicking the run button).

              <li>
                Under specific conditions combined with the asynchronous nature of the way tweak communicates with your website, things might not work at first. For that we advise a page reload after pressing the play/run button to active the extension.
