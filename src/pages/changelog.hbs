    <h3 class="text-dark" title="chrome developer tool to mock http request">v1.0.0</h3>
    <p title="intercept POST request, delay HTTP request and more, debugging proxy">
      We're happy to announce <b>tweak 1.0</b>! After <b>improving the foundations</b> of tweak in the initial releases
      where we mainly focus on making sure the extension intercepts requests consistently across different websites and
      different environments, we decided that now is the right time to <b>focus on new features and enhancing user
        experience</b>. We scanned the extensions in the market, and we cross-referenced dozens of browser extensions
      and their hundreds of reviews to come up with the feature set of this version. We then re-designed from scratch
      the extension UI focusing on productivity and usability, and we add a few other neat functionalities to provide
      you with a sound experience.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature: Allow users to <b>delay a request</b> by a specified amount of time.</li>
      <li>Feature: Add a new action on the top bar to <b>collapse all the expanded rows</b> in the extension.</li>
      <li>Feature: Add a new action on the top bar that allows users to <b>delete all</b> the configurations in one go.
      </li>
      <li>Feature: Allow users to <b>specify the request payload (request body)</b> for <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST" title="POST - HTTP MDN"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">POST</a>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>PATCH</code> requests. The user can edit
        the request payload by clicking the <code>Request Payload</code> tab in the editors area.</li>
      <li>Feature: Allow users to specify the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type"
          title="Content-Type - HTTP MDN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content-Type</a> response header.</li>
      <li>Feature: Allow users to specify the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status"
          title="HTTP response status codes - HTTP MDN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP response status code</a>
        of an intercepted request.</li>
      <li>
        Enhancement: Overall <b>extension re-design with major UI improvements</b>. Some highlights:
        <ul>
          <li title="url field and regular expressions">
            <b>Larger URL field</b> (old <code>URL match expression</code>) with a new regular expression toggle and
            instant input validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Better interception count experience with improved active/inactive states. From this version on, the
            interception counter is always visible even when its value is <code>0</code>. The team hopes that this
            serves as an indicator/call to action in cases where user is expecting an interception but does not get the
            expected result or neither feedback from the extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Larger and slightly more spacious JSON editor(s)</b> with comprehensive footnote captions, to hint users
            towards the right direction when filling in the content based on the type of request their trying to
            intercept.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Feature: allow users to bypass requests despite the original one not being successful (e.g. status
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404" title="404 Not Found - HTTP MDN"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">404</a> or
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500"
          title="500 Internal Server Error - HTTP MDN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500</a> are the most common use
        cases). Users may now simulate calls to resources that don't exist on the server, or even create their own
        routes in the extension to truly simulate an API.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: deleting individual configuration didn't stop the request from being intercepted in the background.
        This might cause
        <i>zombie</i> interceptions, where a request is still intercepted even tough the user deleted the configuration.
        In prior versions
        of tweak the user would have to refresh the page to get rid of the <i>zombie</i> interception.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: compute the proper header <code>Content-Length</code> based on the user defined payload.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintenance: 3rd party security dependencies updates.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-dark">v0.2.0</h3>
    <p title="tweak interceptor, mock responses, any website">Although we didn't introduced new functionalities in this
      release, we did some foundational changes in the
      way that tweak interacts with your website in order to augment the coverage of scenarios where it can intercept
      requests. That's the reason why we also changed our user permissions from <a
        href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/activeTab" title="The activeTab permission - Google Chrome"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">activeTab</a> to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns"
        title="Match Patterns - Google Chrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host permissions</a>, allowing us to fix
      the following fundamental issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Feature: tweak is now able to intercept requests that are fired/triggered at page load ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: tweak interceptions were flaky for applications using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> methods:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/onreadystatechange"
              title="developer mozilla documentation for XMLHttpRequest onreadystatechange" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/load_event"
              title="developer mozilla documentation for XMLHttpRequest onload" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">XMLHttpRequest.onload</a></li>
          <li>and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/loadend_event"
              title="developer mozilla documentation for XMLHttpRequest onloadend" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">XMLHttpRequest.onloadend</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: Prior to this release tweak was not capable of intercepting requests to the same host when the
        configuration had an absolute path in the <code>URL match expression</code> field.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: Prior this release calls to <code>window.fetch</code> with <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request"
          title="developer mozilla documentation for Request" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Request</a> object could
        not be intercepted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bug fix: Bubble up errors that occur during <code>window.fetch</code>. tweak was silencing these errors, which
        would make
        developer's job of debugging the request failure harder. In this new release, tweak properly surfaces the error
        to the
        application.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-dark">v0.1.0</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature: <b>By default turn on the request interception</b> <i>switch</i> toggle when adding a new
        configuration.</li>
      <li>Feature: Notify users about number of intercepted requests by adding a badge counter to the extension icon.
      </li>
      <li>Feature: Add a <i>Run&amp;Stop</i> button on the top bar of the extension for faster access when in need of
        enabling/disabling the extension globally.</li>
      <li>Feature: Small visual improvements:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Small tooltip for the <code>URL match expression</code> configuration field to inform the user about
          advanced usage use cases with regular expressions.</li>
        <li>Custom title for JSON editor present in each configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-dark">v0.0.2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bug fix: Fix memory leak on start/stop extension.</li>
      <li>Bug fix: Improve compatibility of interceptions, better compliance with browser APIs:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Intercept <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/text"
            title="developer mozilla documentation for Body text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Body.text()</a> for

            title="developer mozilla documentation for fetch API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            window.fetch</a> requests.

          requests.
