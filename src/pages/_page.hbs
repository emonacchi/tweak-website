    <b>tweak was temporarily taken down from the Chrome Store</b>. According to the Google team the tweak extension is in violation of the
    <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies#spam" title="chrome store policies link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Spam and Placement in the Store"</a> which means
    that Google considers the description and screenshots of the extension to be <i>"misleading"</i>.
    <b>Tl;dr</b> we are working hard to bring it back, because in our <a href="https://github.com/emonacchi/tweak-website/pull/24" title="GitHub tweak-website release notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last update</a>
    we introduced quite a few improvements that we think you'll love!
